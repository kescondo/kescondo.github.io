### Portfolio
- ðŸ˜„ Hello! I'm Kristina (she/her), and I recently finished up my program at Tech Elevator, a 14-week in-person full-stack coding bootcamp. I'm interested in full-stack, front-end, or mobile development.
- I've started this portfolio to be able to better showcase my projects and coding skills, as well as reflect on my progress as I continue to improve.
