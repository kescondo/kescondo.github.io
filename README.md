### Portfolio
- ðŸ˜„ Hello! I'm Kristina (she/her), and I recently finished up my program at Tech Elevator, a 14-week in-person full-stack coding bootcamp. I'm interested in full-stack, front-end, or mobile development.
- This portfolio aims to showcase my projects and coding skills, as well as reflect on my progress as I continue to improve. I intentionally use Vanilla JavaScript rather than a reactive framework as a learning tool; other libraries, technologies, and frameworks will be reflected in my projects.

### Technology and creative works used in this portfolio
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Decorative images are from Canva
- Google and Adobe Fonts
