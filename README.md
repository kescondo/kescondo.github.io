### Portfolio
- ðŸ˜„ Hello! I'm Kristina (she/her), and I finished up my program at Tech Elevator, a 14-week in-person full-stack coding bootcamp, last December. I'm interested in full-stack, front-end, or mobile development.
- This portfolio aims to be an introduction to my projects and coding skills, as well a living document that reflects my progress as I continue to learn and improve. I intentionally use Vanilla JavaScript rather than a reactive framework as a learning tool; other libraries, technologies, and frameworks will be reflected in my projects, which I aim to grow as my skills do!
